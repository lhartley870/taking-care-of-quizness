# Taking Care of Quizness
Taking Care of Quizness is a site intended to provide an exciting multiple choice quiz experience for anyone who enjoys general knowledge quizzes. Taking Care of Quizness will be useful for quiz enthusiasts as it dynamically provides 5 different sets of quiz questions to keep the user's interest, without any of the quizzes being repeated in the same user session. Each quiz is split into 5 rounds of 3 questions and the quiz allows the user to see what they got correct and incorrect on a round by round basis. The site also provides the user with statistics on which round or rounds were their best as well as the usual total score result at the end. Each question in all 5 sets of quizzes is accompanied by a unique photo to provide appealing visuals during the user's quiz experience. 

The live project can be viewed [here](https://lhartley870.github.io/taking-care-of-quizness/).

## Wireframes

I used [Balsamiq](https://www.balsamiq.com) to create Wireframe mock-ups for laptop/large monitor, tablet and mobile devices which can be found here: 
* [Home Page]() 
* [Quiz Page]() 
* [Results Page]()  

The Wireframes were a useful aid prior to starting to build the site but the design did evolve in the following respects and for the following reasons:

###

### Fonts

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the website fonts. The selected fonts and their fallbacks, should they not import into the site correctly, are as follows:

Selected Font | Fallback Font
------------- | --------------
              | 
              | 
              |

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

This project was deployed to GitHub Pages according to the following steps: 

1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Navigate to the repository that you want to deploy (in the case of this project this is lhartley870/taking-care-of-quizness).
3. At the top of the repository locate the 'Settings button' and click on it. 
4. Down the left hand side of the page there is an option for 'Pages'. Click on that. 
5. Underneath where it says 'Source' there is a dropdown menu which allows you to select a branch of 'master' or 'none'. Select master. 
6. Next to the dropdown menu which allows you to select a branch, there is a dropdown menu which allows you to select a folder of '/(root)' or '/docs'. Ensure that '/(root)' is selected.
6. Click save. 
7. GitHub will then tell you that the site is ready to be published. 
8. Refresh the site and GitHub will tell you that your site is published and provide a link to the live site. It will look like this:

### Forking the GitHub Repository

Forking the GitHub repository allows you to produce a personal copy of the original repository/someone else's project that you can amend without affecting the original repository. To do this:

1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Navigate to the repository that you want to fork. 
3. In the repository header locate the button that says 'Fork' and click on it.  
4. When the repository is copied you will be taken to your copy of the repository. 

### Making a Local Clone

In order to work on a repository you have forked, you will need to clone it to your computer. In order to do this: 

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the repository fork you want to make a local clone of. 
2. Underneath the Settings button at the top of the repository there is a button with a dropdown arrow that says 'Code'. Click on it.  
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, undeneath 'Clone' select 'HTTPS' so that there is an orange line underneath 'HTTPS'. Click on this button:

![View of local clone button]()

4. Open the Terminal in your IDE/editor. 
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory to be located.  
6. Type 'git clone' and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this with your username instead of 'YOUR-USERNAME' and the name of the forked repository you are cloning instead of 'NAME OF REPOSITORY YOU ARE CLONING': 

![View of terminal command to clone fork]()

7. Press enter and your local clone will be created. 

For more information on forking and cloning repositories, see [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and this [GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).
