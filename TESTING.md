# Testing

## Validators
[The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used for testing the html code for the site. The following results show that no errors have been found: 
* [Home page html](/readme-documents/validation-results/)
* [Before You Go page html](/readme-documents/validation-results/)
* [When in Oz page html](/readme-documents/validation-results/)
* [Gallery page html](/readme-documents/validation-results/)
* [Contact page html](/readme-documents/validation-results/)

[The W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used for testing the css code for the site. With the style.css file, validation was run using direct copying and pasting of the css code which gave [this result](/readme-documents/validation-results/) with [this warning](/readme-documents/validation-results/) saying *'Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes'*. I therefore ran the style.css file validation using the URI which gave the following clear results:
* [style.css file](/readme-documents/validation-results/) 
and the warning had disappeared (see [here](/readme-documents/validation-results/)).

[The JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/) was used for testing the javascript code for the site. The following results show that no errors have been found:
